# leftPad: Padding Without the Drama  

Need to pad strings to the left? Look no furtherâ€”this Go package ensures your strings stay properly aligned without any unexpected surprises. Because, as weâ€™ve all learned, padding is serious business.  

## Installation  

Just run:  

```bash  
go get github.com/sgnsyn/left-pad
```

## Usage

```go
  leftpad.Pad("foo", 5)             // Output: "  foo"
  leftpad.Pad("foobar", 6)          // Output: "foobar"  
  leftpad.Pad(1, 2, '0')            // Output: "01"  
  leftpad.Pad(17, 5, '0')           // Output: "00017"
  leftpad.Pad("hi", 5, 'ðŸ˜Š','a')    // Output: "ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Šhi"
```
# Notes

- If you supply more than one character for padding, weâ€™ll quietly focus on the first one. Go is chill like that.
- Fancy characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) are treated as two. Because padding isnâ€™t just for ASCII anymore.
